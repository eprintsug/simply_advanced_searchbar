### Simply Advanced Searchbar

#### A replacement to EPrint's simple searchbar


The simple search functionality in EPrint repositories has some known problems, which lead to inconsistent search results. On the other hand, the advanced search functionality is known for providing more consistent and reliable results.

This plugin aims at combining the ease of use of the simple search bar with the reliability of the advanced search function. 

The trick diverting all the search requests to the advanced search function, allowing the users to specify the search metafields from a drop down menu.

  
Enjoy!
